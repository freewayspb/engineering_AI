# Project Process Rules (BA_AI_GOST)

## Two-stage delivery model
- Stage 1 (Prototypes/POC): produce and validate prototypes fully offline.
  - Deliverable: Technical Specification (TS) for prototypes.
  - Scope: OCR/Parsing (PDF mc/scan, DWG, ARP/GSFX/XML/XLS, DOCX normative), Structuring/Reports, Classification/Project-oriented work.
  - Documentation focus: BR/FR/Use Cases/Schemas complete and atomic; no metrics required now.
  - Demos: Each prototype includes a Demo Script and an Acceptance Checklist.
  - Priority: Do not focus on metrics at this stage; prioritize TS, technical descriptions, and use cases completeness.

- Stage 2 (Product): after prototype validation, prepare TS for the full local product (OpenAI-like document system, air-gapped).
  - Deliverables: Product TS, architecture, data schemas, deployment/operations.
  - Base requirements on validated outcomes from Stage 1.

## Authoring rules in this repo
- Chat with the client in Russian; keep repository files (documentation and code comments) in Russian for this project.
- Prefer atomic Use Cases per task for each input document (from 1–8 table).
- Keep edits minimal and consistent; preserve existing indentation and formatting.
- Cross-link BR ↔ FR ↔ UC where applicable.
- Avoid adding metrics until explicitly requested; capture acceptance as qualitative checklists.

## Files of interest
- documentation/01-project-overview/
- documentation/02-requirements/
- documentation/03-prototypes/
- documentation/06-assets/input-documents/

## Non-functional constraints
- Local, offline operation only (no internet access).
- Role-based access and audit; knowledge portability required.
